🧮 Linux Process Lifecycle Analysis
Analysed the execution of cp -vi .bashrc bashrc.bak to explore process creation, memory management, file operations, and OS-level security in Linux. Tracked user–kernel interactions using system tools like strace, pmap, and ls -l, mapping the full lifecycle from fork to termination.

Explored core OS concepts including virtual memory allocation, file descriptors, and signal handling. Evaluated how Linux enforces permissions, handles faults, and separates memory using the MMU and TLB.

Key Areas Covered:

🔁 Linux process lifecycle (NEW → TERMINATED)

💾 Virtual memory, page faults, and address translation

📂 File operations and I/O: open(), read(), write()

🧠 System calls: fork(), exec(), exit()

🔐 OS security: segmentation faults, permissions, VFS
