Analysed the lifecycle of a Linux command to understand process creation, memory management, file operations, and security mechanisms in modern operating systems.

Used the cp -vi .bashrc bashrc.bak command as a case study to break down system behaviour across user and kernel space, tracking interactions such as system calls, context switching, virtual memory allocation, file descriptors, and process termination.

Mapped the process lifecycle using real Linux outputs (e.g. strace, pmap, ls -l) and diagrams to explain key OS concepts including fork/exec, address space layout, I/O buffering, and signal handling.

Explored OS-level security controls such as file permission enforcement, memory isolation via MMU/TLB, and failure handling through page faults and segmentation protection.

Key areas covered:

Linux process lifecycle (NEW to TERMINATED)

Memory management: virtual memory, paging, page faults

File operations: open, read, write, inode structure

System calls: fork, exec, exit, read

OS-level security: permissions, segmentation faults, virtual file system
