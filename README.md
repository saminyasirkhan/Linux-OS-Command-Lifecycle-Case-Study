ðŸ›« Real-Time OS Design for Autonomous Drones
Developed a proposed real-time operating system architecture for AeroNav Techâ€™s autonomous drone platform, focused on safety-critical functions like navigation, obstacle avoidance, and secure communication. The design applied OS principles such as Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), memory isolation, TLB-backed paging, and interprocess communication to ensure deterministic behaviour and robust protection.

Presented as a technical poster to demonstrate the practical application of OS theory in aerospace and defence contexts.

Key Areas Covered:

ðŸ§® Real-time process scheduling and task prioritisation (RMS)

ðŸ’¾ Paging, TLB usage, and memory isolation

ðŸ”„ Interprocess communication design and synchronisation

Skills: Operating System Design Â· Real-Time Systems Â· Technical Research Â· Embedded Concepts
